# GameZone

GameZone is an app that uses the API of RAWG Video Games Database to display informations about video games.

I used [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/accujazz/api/rawg-video-games-database) as a ressource to get the API key and the endpoints. I used superagent to make the API calls.

I initially wanted to use Sass as a CSS Pre-processor, but the learning scope of this project was already wide, and I decided to focus on a proper implementation of Vue and Typescript

## Technologies applied

- Vue.js
- Vue-router
- Typescript
